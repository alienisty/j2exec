                Added a PumpStreamHandler.setAlwaysWaitForStreamThreads() which allows to skip
                joining with the pumper threads. Having said that - using that flag is for the
                desperate because it could leave up to three worker threads behind but there
                might be situations where this is the only escape.

                Because the ExecuteWatchdog is the only way to destroy asynchronous processes,

                On a Mac, the unit tests never finish. Culprit is InputStreamPumper which

                after the stopProcessing method is called if the process
